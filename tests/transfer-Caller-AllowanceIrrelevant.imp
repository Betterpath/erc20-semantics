test.preamble();

// Testing transfer(To,Value) when To = caller, with allowance assigned
// specifically lower than Value.  So the allowance is irrelevant for transfer.
// The allowance is only relevant for transferFrom.

test.approve(7,20);   // set allowance for caller (7) to itself below the transfered value
test.transfer(7,23);  // transfer 23 to itself, which is larger than the allowance 20
